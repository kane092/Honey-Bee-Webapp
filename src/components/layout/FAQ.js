          <div>
            <div className='pb-2'>Our Policy team will constantly be assessing the health of the Honey Jar (bank) and when possible pollen boosts will be made available to beekeepers.</div>

            <div className='pb-2'>Pollen boosts will be available for a very short amount of time. Only active community members will be aware and able to take advantage. Pollen boosts will provide beekeepers a $HNYb multiplier anywhere between 1.5x-4x. This means that your honey will swap for 1.5x-4x the regular amount of $MATIC.</div>

            <div className='pb-2 font-weight-bold'>DONT MISS ANNOUNCEMENTS FOR A CHANCE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF POLLEN BOOSTS!!!!</div>

            <div className='pb-2'>As a beekeeper, your job is to make sure your bees are working smarter not harder! Is it better to sell your honey as you collect or is it better to HODL and sell at an opportune time? I guess you'll have to be the judge of that and play the game to find out.</div>
          </div>
          <div className='h4 font-weight-bold py-2 pt-3'>What are BeeCity's goals?</div>
          <div>
            <div className='pb-2'><span className='font-weight-bold'>First and foremost we want to build a fun and vibrant community where members can benefit by earning honey to purchase in game rewards or $Matic. </span>There are so many projects who tout this same goal but what separates us is our game model that puts 70% of minting funds and 100% of royalties into the community liquidity locked pool. Devs receive 30% of the mints and 0% of royalties, all of which will be used to further develop the project.</div>

            <div className='pb-2'><span className='font-weight-bold'>We want to develop a long lasting project with plans to launch multiple seasons. </span> Each season will bring different bees to mint, rewards and additional mechanics to make the game feel fresh.</div>

            <div className='pb-2'><span className='font-weight-bold'>We want to launch an <span className='text-warning'>NFT World </span> and create BeeCity within our very own metaverse. </span> Within this world Bee City community members will be able to earn honey, play games, socialize, buy land and so much more! In time we will be reaching out to our community members to assist with building this world.</div>

          <div className='h4 font-weight-bold py-2 pt-3'>Who are the developers behind BeeCity?</div>
          <div>
            We are a very small group of individuals who have been involved in several different crypto communities and felt it was time to start our own community. We came across this fantastic open source model and thought that we could make some adjustments / improvements to make an even better project. Our team consists of developers, designers, marketers and policy makers. As of right now we are actively searching for developers and marketers to add to our team. If you're interested in joining the Bee City team, come meet us on Discord and let us know what you can do in the #Contribution channel.

          <div className='h4 font-weight-bold py-2 pt-3'>How do I know this project isn't just another rug pull?</div>
          <div>
            First, the liquidity pool is locked. There is no way anyone can access it. Not developers, not hackers, not anyone. Period. Don't believe us? Our contracts have also been both internally audited AND by a third part to ensure we are rug-proof.

          <div className='h4 font-weight-bold py-2 pt-3'>When will the metaverse launch?</div>
          <div>
            Bee City will be purchasing an <span className='text-warning'>NFT World </span> as soon as the developer wallet raises the necessary amount of funds. Once we launch the metaverse, we will need dozens of builders. If you are interested in building, please let us know in the #Metaverse channel in the discord server.

          <div className='h4 font-weight-bold py-2 pt-3'>What do you plan to build within the metaverse?</div>
          <div>
            We have a vision as to how the metaverse should look and what there will be to do within Bee City but ultimately we would like it to be a community decision. Here are just a few of our ideas:

            <ul className='pt-3'>
              <li>Develop a BeeCity role playing game that will reward players for accomplishing quests, defeating bosses, winning PVP arenas, etc.</li>
              <li>Beekeepers vs Bees game mode that distribute a fair split token rewards to the winning team in each match.</li>
              <li>Bee catcher free for all game mode that reward the top percentage of players in each match.</li>
              <li>Community vs Community events hosted within Bee City but also in other worlds.</li>
              <li>Social events such as karaoke, movie nights, comedy nights, etc.</li>
              <li>Generate plots of land that will be for sale to members of Bee City.</li>
              <li>And MUCH More!</li>
            </ul>
